# OpenScenario_Converter
A Tool for converting log files of a specific type into basic OpenScenario format


To use, either recreate the project in your own IDE, or use the provided jar file (out/artifcats.../) with command line arguments as follows: 
1. Log file to convert from (MUST be in the same format as seen in the paper).
2. Name of OpenScenario file to be produced (lookahead distance will be appended to this). 
3. CARLA map that is used in the scenario.
